Fractal Images in python

1. Open the Von_Kock_Curves.py in editor
2. N is number of recursions, angle is the angle in radians, D is orientation of figure, r is length (scales it does not matter)
3. Run the program with wanted input.
4. Fractals should come out.

It is a rather simple implementation, and my first try at fractals. I would not recommend N higher than 10 as it runs in exponential time.
